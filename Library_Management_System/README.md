# Library Management System made by Anis Partovov 
This project is like a digital helper for libraries. It keeps track of books, customers, and staff, making borrowing and returning books easier. It's made using PSQL and stores lots of book details, like availability and cost. Plus, it helps manage library members and staff efficiently.

## Database
Create a new database named "Library" to store the information.

Book Management: Add, edit, or delete books in the library's collection. Keep tabs on details like title, genre, rental fee, availability, author, and publisher.

Customer Management: Keep a record of library members, including their names, addresses, when they joined, and what books they've borrowed.

Employee Management: Organize library staff, including their names, roles, salaries, and which branch they work in.

Book Borrowing and Returning: Keep track of who borrowed which books and when they're due back. Make sure books are returned on time.

Branch Management: Manage information about library branches, like their numbers, who manages them, addresses, and contact information.


## Some Queries to make sure that my database works 

### The project involves using PSQL queries and data analysis to gain useful information from the library's data. Some important queries include:


1) Get the titles, categories, and rental prices of all available books.

2) Show the names of employees and their salaries, sorted by salary in descending order.

3) Retrieve book titles and the customers who have borrowed them.

4) Show the total count of books in each category.

5) Display the names and positions of employees earning over Rs. 30,000.

6) List the names of customers who registered before November 2, 2023, and haven't borrowed any books yet.

7) Display branch numbers and the total count of employees in each branch.

8) Show the names of customers who borrowed books in May 2023.

9) Retrieve book titles categorized as "Fiction".

10) Display branch numbers along with the count of employees for branches with more than one employee.
